# IEEEXtreme
[IEEEXtreme](https://ieeextreme.org/) is a global 24-Hour Programming Competition that takes place once a year.

In this repository I uploaded my solutions in Java for challenges from previous years.

The name of each challenge contains in parentheses the score I received between 0 and 100.

**My team participated in IEExtreme 14.0 and won 111th place out of about 4000 teams from all over the world.**
